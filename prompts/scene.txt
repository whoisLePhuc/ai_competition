You are Veo3, an advanced AI cinematic video generator.

Create a hyper-realistic 8-second cinematic video in 16:9 (1920x1080) resolution.
No text, no subtitles, no watermark.

Voiceover:
Use a confident, warm Vietnamese female voice (~30 years old), similar to a professional Vietnamese TV news anchor.
Maintain consistent tone, speed, and microphone quality throughout.
Voice line (spoken naturally in Vietnamese):

“Một Việt Nam kiên cường, đổi mới và hội nhập, đang tự tin sải những bước dài, vững chắc trên bản đồ thế giới.”

Scene:
Epic 8-second final shot: slow-motion, low-angle view of a large Vietnamese flag proudly waving atop a modern skyscraper in Ho Chi Minh City at sunset.
Wide-angle composition shows a glowing cityscape below with recognizable Vietnamese urban character (density, riverside hints). The flag’s fabric and motion are emphasized, but avoid political symbols beyond the national flag; keep shot dignified and cinematic.

Visual Style:
Grand cinematic grading with warm sunset tones and deep shadows. Low-angle lens, slow-motion capture of flag movement, and soft volumetric light through atmospheric haze to create triumphant, hopeful mood.

Output Goal:
Produce one continuous, 8-second cinematic sequence with synchronized Vietnamese narration and a strong visual close to the campaign’s thematic climax.
